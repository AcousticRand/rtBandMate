Lyrics - tabs repository software for band members

Plan:
* Be able to enter lyrics in a text format
* maybe using a wysiwyg editor with some customized buttons.
* maybe a chord dropdown
* sort by artist or title
* store info about special considerations for band members like:
  * special instrument (indicating change)
  * patch (i.e. Joel's vocal)
  * track needed
  

# Details
We'll need a database, and I'm thinking a mongo or other document database
might be best suited, based on the fact that not every record will need all
the fields, and if I think of new fields later, it'll be easy to add them.


## database
* mongo libs
* get basics down
* need a menu
* user
  * need a create screen
  * need to alter for edit capability
  * need a delete option with extra confirmations
* song
  * need create/edit/delete

## lastly
